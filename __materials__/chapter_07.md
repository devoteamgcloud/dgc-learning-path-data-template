## Learning Practical Path 

## Chapter 7 - Looker Studio & Data Visualization Fundamentals (1-2 days)

![Your mission architecture](img/architecture_datastudio.png)

### The Context

Fantastic ! You should have by now the aggregated tables you need. However, the task is not completely done yet. Indeed, you can't imagine a Magasin & Cie manager using only your tables (some of them with thousands and thousands rows of data), to have a great overview of the status of their store or take crucial decisions. 

Last step of the full pipeline: Looker Studio (previously known as Data Studio)

As precised in the first chapter, you will need to implement for them some dashboards. A dashboard is a visual representation of the data that could be used by some non tech collaborators. It often takes the form of different graphs and charts (from time series chart, to pie chart, or even geographic charts).

What a nice coincidence ! It exists different Google tools for designing such dahsboards. One of the most frequent and easy to learn is called Looker Studio. But this is not the only one as you will for example discover a more advanced and fine-grained (and more expensive) tool in chapter 12 which is called Looker.

But let's go back to Looker Studio for now, you will already have many things to learn and experiment !

### The Learning Resources

Normally, you should have already followed along several chapters. You should now be able to be quite autonomous.
Thus, we provide you only the Looker Studio Help page where you can find the answer to pretty much every question you could have. If you really need more help, connect with your colleagues or search for the answer online. I am sure that you are now able to handle it on your own ! ðŸ’ª

### Your mission

To begin with Looker Studio, you can copy and paste the template below to your personal Google Drive.

(some pages are only available when the edit mode is activated)

Well, actually, we did not tell you everything ! We indeed already created all the tables in BigQuery and the managers already presented us with a few use cases. Therefore we have already designed some dashboards that allowed the managers to gain data insight. You will find some of these examples here : ... @todo
After having seen these and trying to understand how it got implemented. You will have different missions.  
Must have :  
- Reproduce the best you can the dashboards already created  
- Create some well chosen dashboards thanks to the data that are the most relevant according to the managers.
- A manager is not really familiar with BI Vizualisation of data and thus does not know which data is relevant. But he does have some needs and expressed his needs with some questions. Design the best dashboards you can think of with the correct sources of data to complete his demands
Great to have :  
- Propose some new charts and vizualisations that you think a manager could benefit from.
Nice to have :  
- Do you have any idea of another aggregated table (or several tables) that could be great in order to design some new dashboards ?
- Do you have any remarks on the data used (aggregated, as well as raw, staging and cleaned) ? (see tips)

Tip 1: Look at your data in BQ or using your Data Studio dahsboards
Tip 2: Do you remark any weird data ?
Tip 3: For example, do you think the dashboard(s) you designed for Aziz is/are realistic ?
